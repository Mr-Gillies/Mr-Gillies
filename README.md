# Hey, I'm Ryan

I'm learning cloud security and infrastructure as code â€” mostly by working with AWS, Terraform, and GitHub. I'm building small projects to help me understand how things work, and I use this space to track and share what Iâ€™m learning publicly.

Later this year, Iâ€™ll be starting the **Computer Systems Technician â€“ Networking** program and the **Cloud Development and Operations** program at **Algonquin College**, where I plan to build on what Iâ€™m already learning hands-on.

## What Iâ€™m Working On

- Building secure AWS infrastructure using Terraform
- Understanding cloud access control and encryption
- Learning how CI/CD pipelines work using GitHub Actions
- Improving documentation and structure as I go

---

## Whatâ€™s Next

- IAM permissions and audit strategies
- Hosting a static website securely with CloudFront
- Reusable Terraform modules for common infrastructure
- Continued focus on cloud security best practices

---

## Featured Project

**[secure-s3-terraform](https://github.com/Mr-Gillies/secure-s3-terraform)**  
A security-focused Terraform setup for creating an encrypted, versioned, and access-restricted S3 bucket on AWS. Built as part of my self-study in cloud fundamentals and security best practices.
